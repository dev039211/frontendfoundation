# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

The website was built with a mobile first approach and should flex based on screen size.

An example of the mobile layout is below

An example of the desktop layout is below

As you can see, both webpages have the same content, but the format changes based on screensize. That was the big take away from this project, outside of the use of columns, rows, and other HTML/CSS formatting.
